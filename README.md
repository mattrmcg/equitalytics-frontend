[Equitalytics](https://www.equitalytics.com) is a platform for analyzing fundamental company data along with key financial ratios and metrics. Equitalytics has aggregated yearly filing data from over 2500 public companies for quick and convenient access by users of the site.

All data is aggregated, validated, and stored on the backend. Some metrics are sourced directly from the SEC, while many of the ratios as well as the piotroski scoring is calculated from the retrieved data.

Unfortunately, many companies do not report certain metrics under the same names, so data for some companies may be omitted because it was either not included or included under an unrecognized naming scheme. This is something I'm actively working to fix.

The backend repository is located [here](https://github.com/mattrmcg/equitalytics-backend). This is where the bulk of the code written for the project is stored.
